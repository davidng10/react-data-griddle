# Data Griddle - A performant React Data Grid

A virtualized, DOM-based data grid for React. The component supports large datasets while keeping
selection, editing, and pointer interactions off the main cell-rendering path.

## Features

- Virtualized rows and center columns
- Left and right frozen columns
- Cell focus, range selection, and checkbox row selection
- Keyboard navigation and type-to-edit
- Custom cell, header, editor, and selection-checkbox renderers
- Stable-ID imperative cell focus
- Synchronous validation and asynchronous commits
- Within-zone column reordering
- Column resizing with optional persistence callbacks

## Usage

The ESM library lives in `packages/data-griddle`. Publication is disabled while the first
experimental release is prepared; `0.0.0` is a local placeholder, not the chosen release version.
Build and pack it locally, then install the tarball in your application.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build:lib
cd packages/data-griddle
npm pack
# From your consuming application:
npm install /path/to/data-griddle-0.0.0.tgz
```

Import `data-griddle/styles.css` once in your application entry. The JavaScript entry does not
automatically inject CSS. In Next.js use the root layout (App Router) or `pages/_app.tsx`.

```tsx
"use client";

import "data-griddle/styles.css";

import { useState } from "react";
import { DataGrid } from "data-griddle";

import type { CellCommit, Column } from "data-griddle";

type Person = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  role: string;
};

const columns: Column<Person>[] = [
  {
    id: "name",
    name: "Name",
    width: 220,
    frozen: "left",
    accessor: (row) => row.name,
    editable: true,
  },
  {
    id: "role",
    name: "Role",
    width: 180,
    accessor: (row) => row.role,
    editable: true,
  },
];

export function PeopleGrid() {
  const [rows, setRows] = useState<Person[]>([
    { id: 1, name: "Ada", role: "Engineer" },
  ]);
  const [columnOrder, setColumnOrder] = useState(
    columns.map((column) => column.id)
  );

  const commit = ({ rowId, columnId, nextValue }: CellCommit<Person>) => {
    setRows((current) =>
      current.map((row) =>
        row.id === rowId ? { ...row, [columnId]: nextValue } : row
      )
    );
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ height: 480 }}>
      <DataGrid
        rows={rows}
        columns={columns}
        getRowId={(row) => row.id}
        columnOrder={columnOrder}
        onColumnOrderChange={setColumnOrder}
        onCellCommit={commit}
        enableRowSelection
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The grid fills its parent, so its container must have a defined height. Row data remains owned by
the caller; commit handlers must update `rows` with accepted values.

## Loading and empty results

Pass application-owned request activity through `loading` (default `false`). The required `rows`
prop accepts `null` and `undefined` for an unavailable result; an empty array means a completed
result with no rows. Preserve that distinction instead of replacing missing data with `[]`.

```tsx
<DataGrid
  rows={data}
  loading={isFetching}
  columns={columns}
  getRowId={(row) => row.id}
  aria-label="People"
  loadingLabel="Updating people"
  emptyContent={<span>No matching people</span>}
/>
```

Here `data` and `isFetching` come from your application. The grid does not fetch or cache data.

| Rows                 | Loading | Display                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `null` / `undefined` | `true`  | Headers and skeleton rows, without a spinner                                 |
| `null` / `undefined` | `false` | Headers and a blank body; the app handles errors or instructions             |
| Any array            | `true`  | Retained result beneath an overlay covering headers and body, with a spinner |
| `[]`                 | `false` | Empty content, defaulting to “No rows”                                       |
| Populated array      | `false` | Normal grid                                                                  |

Keep supplying previous rows during sorting, filtering, or pagination requests to retain them under
the overlay. Passing missing rows removes that result and shows the initial skeleton while loading.
Initial skeleton bars gently pulse to show activity. The existing skeleton fallback for virtualized
rendering gaps stays static and works independently of `loading`.

`loadingIndicator` replaces only the refresh indicator; the grid owns overlay placement and behavior.
`emptyContent` replaces empty-result content. Explicit `null` hides either visual. Keep custom
indicators noninteractive; `loadingLabel` supplies the accessible announcement independently.
The default spinner always rotates, including when reduced motion is enabled. Custom indicators
control their own animation behavior.

Loading blocks pointer and keyboard interactions inside the grid, including custom cell/header
controls and the editor portal. Outside controls remain usable. Active resize/reorder gestures are
cancelled without committing, selection stops at its current range, and pending saves finish normally.
An active editor is paused with its draft intact and resumes against the same row ID. If the edited
row or column disappears, a notice preserves the draft until its target returns or you explicitly
discard it. Focus is restored after a background refresh unless you moved it to another control.
As usual, an outside click before loading begins may commit an edit.

`id`, `className`, and `style` apply to the stationary outer frame; accessible naming applies to the
focusable inner scroller. Code that previously used the root element as the scroll container must
account for this new wrapper. Loading styles are included in the exported stylesheet. Customize their
colors through CSS variables on the frame:

```css
.my-grid {
  --dgr-loading-overlay-background: rgb(255 255 255 / 65%);
  --dgr-loading-indicator-color: #57534e;
  --dgr-empty-color: #78716c;
}
```

The packed-consumer fixture exercises initial loading, refresh and empty results. Custom indicators
and delayed refresh while editing need a dedicated consumer scenario; the local app is a basic grid.

## Column behavior

Explicit column widths are preserved, even when they leave unused space. The last column in visual
order without a `width` or a width override fills the remaining viewport width; earlier unspecified
columns use the 140px default. The available space excludes the checkbox gutter and all other
columns, including frozen columns. Automatic sizing respects `minWidth` (48px by default) and
`maxWidth`: insufficient room causes horizontal scrolling, while a maximum can leave unused space.

Manually resizing an automatic column gives it an explicit width for the session. The last remaining
unspecified column then fills the space, if there is one. Controlled `columnWidths` and
`defaultColumnWidths` also count as explicit widths. Removing a controlled override restores the
column's eligibility for automatic sizing when its schema has no `width`. Container-driven sizing
does not emit `onColumnWidthsChange`.

- `accessor` reads the displayed value from a row.
- `editable` enables editing; `renderEditor` can provide a custom editor.
- `renderCell` and `renderHeader` customize read-mode cells and headers.
- `parseValue` converts a draft before validation and commit.
- `validate` returns an error message to reject a value.
- `onCommit` overrides the grid-level `onCellCommit` for one column.
- `frozen` pins a column to the left or right zone.
- `selectable`, `resizable`, `reorderable`, and `reorderBarrier` customize normal-column behavior.
- `type: 'action'` is always non-selectable, non-editable, non-resizable, non-reorderable, and a
  reorder barrier; explicit capability props cannot override those invariants.

Row selection, column order, and column widths support controlled and uncontrolled use through
`value`/`defaultValue`/`onChange`-style prop groups. Reordering and resizing work internally by
default. A controlled value without its change callback is read-only and its matching affordances
are disabled.

Frozen columns are always rendered rather than horizontally virtualized. Keep the number frozen on
each side small for large grids.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev              # library watch + single-grid Next.js app
pnpm test             # source regressions
pnpm lint             # ESLint + library/app/fixture types
pnpm build            # ESM library + static single-grid app
pnpm check:package    # build + artifact contract
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm check:consumers  # real tarballs in isolated Vite/Next consumers
```

See [INTERNALS.md](https://github.com/davidng10/react-data-grid/blob/main/INTERNALS.md) for the rendering model and performance constraints.

## Styling and themes

Default styles are scoped to grid-owned classes; import `data-griddle/styles.css`. Set
`--dgr-*` variables on the frame or an ancestor; active body-mounted editors copy their originating
grid's theme. Columns accept `cellClassName` and `headerClassName` as strings or context callbacks.
Use `rowHeight` and column widths for geometry; CSS controls appearance.

See the [styling contract](https://github.com/davidng10/react-data-grid/blob/main/docs/STYLING.md) for tokens, defaults, parts, callback contexts, and
portal synchronization limits. The guide includes theme and conditional-class examples; the local
app does not include an interactive theme showcase.

## Integration APIs

See the [integration guide](https://github.com/davidng10/react-data-grid/blob/main/docs/INTEGRATION.md) for controlled/uncontrolled/read-only state,
stable identity, editing and persistence, custom selection controls, and the `DataGridHandle.focusCell`
command. Run `pnpm dev` and open `/` for the basic editable grid. Packed-consumer fixtures cover
additional public-API scenarios; their setup and coverage are described in the verification guide below.

Stores and geometry helpers remain private. See [package verification](https://github.com/davidng10/react-data-grid/blob/main/docs/PACKAGE_VERIFICATION.md)
for exact tested versions and remaining limitations.

## Accessibility and interaction

See [keyboard, touch and accessibility guidance](https://github.com/davidng10/react-data-grid/blob/main/docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md) for navigation, native control
tab order, editor behavior, remaining touch/column interaction gaps and the manual test matrix.
Source semantics and keyboard navigation are implemented; target-browser, physical-device and
screen-reader support remains unverified. Applications must adapt frozen widths and columns to
narrow containers; the basic app does not demonstrate responsive unpinning.

## Workspace and releases

- `packages/data-griddle/`: canonical source, styles, tests, ESM build and declarations.
- `apps/docs/`: a single-grid Next.js App Router development app.
- `fixtures/`: isolated packed consumers, copied outside the workspace by verification scripts.
- `docs/`: repository guides, read directly as Markdown.

The development app consumes only public package exports. `pnpm dev` builds the library first and watches
it alongside Next.js; restart it after changing the public export map. No Turborepo or Nx is needed.

One package will support future stable and experimental npm tags. Tags, versions and Git branches
are separate decisions; preview consumers should pin an exact version. The first release will be
experimental, with no stable compatibility promise. Stable documentation must be deployed from a
revision using the corresponding stable library, never silently follow experimental development.
Both packages are private and the library also rejects `prepublishOnly`; no publication or deployment
workflow is enabled. Release version, channel and public repository location remain deliberate gates.
